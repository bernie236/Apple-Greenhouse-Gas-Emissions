# Apple-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions

## About the Project
A breakdown of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022 as they aim to reach net zero emissions by 2030. In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. This dataset includes every source of emissions from both their corporate operations and their product life cycle, the carbon footprint of their baseline iPhone in the same period, and normalizing factors like sales, market cap, and employees.

## Questions for the Analysis
1. How has Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions changed in the past 7 years? Have they decreased the carbon footprint of their iPhone products? 
2. Are Apple’s green initiatives profitable?
3. Where is the majority of their greenhouse gas emissions coming from by description? What about by scope?

## Key Insights from the Dataset
1. Between 2015-2022, Apple has had an average decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per year by 8.43%.
2. Apple’s green initiatives have not only led to a decrease in emissions but have also resulted in an average 8.2% year over year increase in revenue and an average 24.59% yearly increase in market capitalization.
3. Manufacturing (~74%), product use (~18%), and product transportation (~6%) makes up ~98% of Apple’s emissions.
